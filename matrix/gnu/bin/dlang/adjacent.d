module matrix.gnu.bin.dlang.adjacent;

/** 
Advances r until it finds the first two adjacent elements a, b that satisfy pred(a, b). Performs ÎŸ(r.length) evaluations of pred.
For more information about pred see find.
Parameters:
pred 	The predicate to satisfy.
Range r 	A forward range to search in.
Returns:
r advanced to the first occurrence of two adjacent elements that satisfy the given predicate. If there are no such two elements, returns r advanced until empty.
